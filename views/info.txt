Hi!

Look at the above example: include </matt/hi.scad>;

This includes the file "hi.scad" by user "matt" (that's me!) to your working script. Remove it by commenting out or deleting the line; You can view the file by itself here: https://hipcad.com/matt/hi.scad

Create, share and link files together to build objects. Sign up here (email for password reset only*).

*There is also a welcome email.
